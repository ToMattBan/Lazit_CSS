# LazIt CSS

It was born with the idea that the user (dev) must have all the control of his tools. 

If it's a tool, so it must have a function, or more than one. Like, you can use a screwdriver as a hammer if you want, can't you? So why you woulnd't be able to use LazIt as you want?

This is what it does, you make it what you want it to be, I'm just giving you a way to do it.

If you have any issues, just let me know.  
If you want to buy me a coffe, just let me know.  
If you want to conquer the word, just let me know.  
If you have another other problem, just forget that I exist.
