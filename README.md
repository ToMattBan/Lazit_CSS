# LazIt CSS

It was born with the idea that the user (dev) must have all the control of his tools.

If it's a tool, so it must have a function, or more than one. Like, you can use a screwdriver as a hammer if you want, can't you? So why you woulnd't be able to use LazIt as you want?

This is what it does, you make it what you want it to be, I'm just giving you a way to do it.

If you have any issues, just let me know.  
If you want to buy me a coffe, just let me know.  
If you want to conquer the word, just let me know.  
If you have another other problem, just forget that I exist.

## Installation

First, install Lazit as a dependency in your project using one of the following package managers:

`npm install lazit-css` or `pnpm add lazit-css` or `yarn add lazit-css`

## Customization (Optional)

To tailor Lazit to your project's needs, you can create a `lazit.conf.json` file in the root of your project. This JSON file lets you define various configuration options to customize the utility classes generated by Lazit.

### Setup

The setup section contains the main configuration options for Lazit:

    setup {
      prefix: The prefix preceding utility classes (e.g., _dn for display utilities).
      separator: The separator between the prefix and utility class (e.g., _d-n for display utilities).
      defaultFontSize: The default font size.
      rootVars: Define a list with all the CSS variables the user wants to be created. Supported values are `enabled: true`, `colors: true`, `spacements: true`
    }

### Settings

The settings section allows you to configure various settings for your utility classes:

    {
      breakpoints: Define responsive breakpoints for your project.

  }
  ```

## Generating Utility Classes

Once Lazit is installed and, optionally, your `lazit.conf.json` is configured, you can generate utility classes using the following command:

`npx lazit-css`

This command will generate utility classes based on your configuration and save them to a CSS file.

## Importing Lazit

To use the utility classes in your project, import Lazit as follows:

`import 'lazit-css';`
